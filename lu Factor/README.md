# luFactor
   The function luFactor is designed to take a square matrix of coefficient values and return the lower triangular matrix, 
upper triangular matrix, and the pivot matrix. The function uses a combination of the Gauss elimination and partial pivoting
to produce a series of matricies that together create the identity matrix of the original data values. This function is 
particurly useful when working with a closed system and several of the coefficients must be adjusted but the final product 
remains the same or vice versa.
